# Blockchain Job Portal 

This project contains the smart contract (written with Solidity) that allows the functionality for creating and applying to jobs. The contract can hold the amount in escrow and freelancers can apply to job by submitting some fee to the contract (currently 10 Wei for testing).


## Upcoming Features
* Releasing the amount to the freelancer's address
* Handling disputes
* Frontend (NextJS)

I will update the readme as the application grows.
